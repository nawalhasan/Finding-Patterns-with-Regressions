# Data Analysis 2: Finding Patterns with Regressions

This repository is dedicated to all the assignments for Data Analysis 2: Finding Patterns with Regressions. In this course we unconvered patterns of asssociation using regression analysis. We used modelling with cross-sectional data where dependent variable is continuous or binary and basic time-series analysis.

# Course Content:

1. Simple Regression (non-parametric, OLS)
2. Complicated patterns and messy data (transformations, functional forms,
measurement errors)
3. Generalizing results of a regression
4. Multiple linear regression (using more xs)
5. Probability models (binary dependent variables)
6. Regression with time series data
